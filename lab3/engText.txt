(SCENE: HARRY IS DRESSED IN A POLICE OFFICER'S UNIFORM; McCALLISTER FAMILY IS QUICKLY ENTERING AND EXITING)

HARRY:
Miss. Young lady! Excuse me. Girls! Hey, hey, little guy. Hey! Excuse me, girls. Girls! Hey, big fella! Excuse me. Ma'am, excuse me. Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey, son. Son! Big fella. Hey, hey hey, little guy, little guy!

Help me make the beds in the living room.

Come on down here!

Hey, son!
Big fella. Hey, little guy! Little guy!

Pete's brother and his family are here.

Trish is going to Montreal.

Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

- Then we're off. - When?

- Tomorrow. - You're not ready, are you?

KEVIN:
Mom, Uncle Frank won't let me watch the movie, but the big kids can. Why can't I?

KATE:
Kevin, I'm on the phone. (Back on the phone) When do you come back? Not 'til then?

KEVIN:
It's not even rated R. He's just being a jerk.

KATE:
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no, then it must be really bad. No, we put the dog in the kennel for the-- (Kevin gets on the bed and starts reading a magazine) Hey hey hey, get off! Kevin, out of the room.

KEVIN:
Hang up the phone and make me, why don't ya?
KATE:
This kid. (Peter enters)

PETER:
Kate, did you pick up a voltage adaptor thing?

KATE:
No, I didn't have time to do that.

KEVIN:
Then how do I shave in France?

KATE:
Grow a goatee.

KEVIN:
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

PETER:
You don't have anything to do? I have something for you to do. You can pick up those MicroMachines that are all over in there. Aunt Leslie stepped on one of them and almost broke her neck.

KATE:
He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun.

PETER:
Didn't we talk about that?
KEVIN:
Did I burn down the joint? I don't think so. I was making ornaments out of fish hooks.

PETER:
My new fish hooks?

KEVIN:
I can't make them out of old ones, with dry worm guts stuck on them.

KATE:
Peter...?

PETER:
Come on, Kevin. Out. (Peter picks up Kevin; enter Leslie)

LESLIE:
Peter, Kate, do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

PETER:
Here! Here's a voltage adapter! (He gives Kevin to Leslie)

LESLIE:
Oh God, you're getting heavy! (Drops Kevin) Go pack your suitcase.

KEVIN:
Pack my suitcase?

(CUT TO ? AND FULLER DOWNSTAIRS)

?: Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?

FULLER: I don't live here.

?: I don't believe. in a house with this many people, there's no shampoo.

HARRY:
Are your folks home?

?:
Yeah, but they don't live here. (Walks up the stairs while Tracy walks down; Exit ?) Tracy, did you order the pizza?

TRACY:
Buzz did.

HARRY:
Excuse me, Miss? Are your parents home?

TRACY:
My parents live in Paris, sorry. (Exit Tracy, enter Sondra)

HARRY:
Hi!

Sondra:
Hi!

HARRY:
Are your parents home?

Sondra:
Yeah.

HARRY:
Do they live here?

SONDRA:
No. (Exit Sondra)

HARRY:
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents. Probably a fancy orphanage.

(CUT TO KEVIN AND JEFF UPSTAIRS)

KEVIN:
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done this once in my whole life.

JEFF:
Tough.

KEVIN:
That's what Megan said. (Enter Megan)

MEGAN:
What did I say?

JEFF:
You told Kevin "Tough."

MEGAN:
The dope was whining about a suitcase. What was I supposed to say? "Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

KEVIN:
I'm not an idiot!

MEGAN:
Oh, really? You're completely helpless! Everyone has to do everything for you.

JEFF:
She's right, Kev.

KEVIN:
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase. (Enter Linnie)

LINNIE:
I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.

JEFF:
Shut up, Linnie.

KEVIN:
Do you know what I should pack?

JEFF:
Buzz told you, cheek-face. Toilet paper and water. (Exit Jeff)

LINNIE:
Listen, Kevin, what are you so worried about? You know Mom's gonna pack your stuff, anyway. You're what the French call "les incompetents".

KEVIN:
What?

(CUT TO JEFF AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS)

JEFF:
Bombs away! (Jeff throws bag that lands right at Harry's feet.)

(CUT TO KEVIN AND LINNIE)

LINNIE:
P.S.: You have to sleep on the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he's going to wet the bed. (Exit Linnie)

KEVIN:
This house is so full of people. It makes me sick! When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'm living alone! I'm living alone!

(CUT TO BUZZ'S ROOM)

ROD:
Who's gonna feed your spider while we're gone?

BUZZ:
He just ate a load of mice guts. He should be good for a couple of weeks. Is it true French babes don't shave their pits?

ROD:
Some don't.

BUZZ:
But they got nude beaches.

ROD:
Not in the winter. (Enter Kevin)

KEVIN:
Buzz?

BUZZ:
Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

KEVIN:
Can I sleep in your room? I don't want to sleep in the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed.

BUZZ:
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass. (Buzz looks out the window) Check it out. Old man Marley. (Rod, Kevin, and Buzz watch Old Man Marley outside Buzz's window)

ROD:
Who's he?

BUZZ:
You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

ROD:
No.

BUZZ:
That's him. Back in '58, he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block... with a snow shovel. Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since.

ROD:
If he's the shovel slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him?

BUZZ:
Not enough evidence to convict. They never found the bodies. But everyone around here knows he did it. It'll just be a matter of time, before he does it again.

ROD:
What's he doing now?

BUZZ:
He walks up and down the street every night, salting the sidewalks.

ROD:
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

BUZZ:
No way. You see that garbage can full of salt? That's where he keeps his victims. The salt turns the bodies into mummies.

ROD:
Wow.

KEVIN:
Mummies! (Old Man Marley looks up)

BUZZ:
Look out! (Buzz closes the drapes)

(CUT TO PIZZA BOY DRIVING TO MCCALISTTER HOUSE; HITS STATUE; PIZZA BOY PICKS IT UP)

(CUT TO MCCALLISTER HOUSE: HARRY, FULLER, AND ?)

HARRY:
How you kids doing, huh? Good? Lot of action around here today, huh? Going on vacation? Where you going? You hear me, or what? Going on a trip? Where you going, kid?

PIZZA BOY:
Okay, that's $122.50.

HARRY:
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

PIZZA BOY:
Oh, you just around for the holidays?

HARRY:
I guess you could say that.

FRANK:
Hey, pizza's here!

PIZZA BOY:
There you go. That's $122.50.

FRANK:
It's my brother's house. He'll take care of it. (All kids go into the kitchen)

HARRY:
Hey, listen... (Enter Peter)

PETER:
Hey.

HARRY:
Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

PETER:
Yeah.

HARRY:
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

PETER:
Yes.

PIZZA BOY:
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

HARRY:
I'd like a word with you, sir.

PETER:
Am I under arrest or something?

HARRY:
No, no, no, no. It's Christmas time. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays. So we're just checking the neighborhood to see if everyone's taking the proper precautions; that's all.

PETER:
Oh, yeah. Well we have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors. That's about as well as anybody can do these days, right? Did you get some eggnog or something like that? (Enter Buzz)

BUZZ: Come on, Dad. Let's eat. (Exit Buzz and Peter)

HARRY: Eggnog? (Enter Kevin) Listen, are you going to be leaving...?

KEVIN: Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

(CUT TO KITCHEN)

LESLIE:
Grab yourself a napkin, and you're going to have to pour your own drinks.

?:
Mom, does Santa Claus have to go through customs?

FULLER:
What time do we have to go to bed?

FRANK:
Early. We're leaving the house at 8 a.m. On the button.

KATE:
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to get rid of it.

PETER:
Honey, the pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.

KATE:
For pizza?

PETER:
10 pizzas times 12 bucks.

LESLIE:
Frank, you've got money! Come on...

FRANK:
Traveler's checks.

KATE:
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

PETER:
You probably got the checks that don't work in France.

KEVIN:
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

BUZZ:
Oh, yeah, we did. But if you want any, somebody's gonna have to barf it up, because it's gone.

LESLIE:
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

BUZZ:
Kev! Kev, get a plate. (Buzz chokes on the cheese; Kevin pushes him into the table and Buzz barfs)

PETER:
Passports! (Peter spills Pepsi)

FRANK:
Watch it! (Frank's chair is pulled out and hits Fuller; people start to clean up kitchen table quickly)

PETER:
No, no. Get these passports out of here. (Peter throws away a bunch of napkins, along with Kevin's airline ticket; Leslie picks Fuller up)

LESLIE:
Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right? (Kate grabs Kevin's hand)

KATE:
What is the matter with you?

KEVIN:
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose. He knows I hate sausage and olives...

FRANK:
Look what you did, you little jerk!

KATE:
Kevin, get upstairs right now.

KEVIN:
Why?

JEFF:
Kevin, you're such a disease.

KEVIN:
Shut up!

PETER:
Kevin, upstairs!

KATE:
Say good night, Kevin.

KEVIN:
"Good night, Kevin." (Exit Kevin & Kate, and Kate takes Kevin out of the room by his arm)

(CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS WHERE KEVIN AND KATE MEET PIZZA BOY)

KEVIN:
Why do I always get treated like scum?

KATE:
Oh, I'm sorry. This house is just crazy. We've got all these extra kids running around and my brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts. (Kate hands Pizza Boy money)

KEVIN:
How come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas?

PIZZA BOY:
Nice tip. Thanks a lot. (Exit Pizza Boy, enter Harry)

KATE:
Thanks.

HARRY:
Having a reunion or something?

KATE:
Oh no. My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family. (Harry smiles at Kevin, showing his gold tooth) He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.

HARRY:
You're taking a trip to Paris?

KATE:
Yes. We hope to leave tomorrow morning.

HARRY:
Excellent. Excellent.

KATE:
If you'll excuse me, this one's a little out of sorts. I'll be right back. (Kate and Kevin go upstairs)

HARRY:
Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband already. And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands. (Exit Harry)

(CUT TO UPSTAIRS)

KATE:
There are 15 people in this house and you're the only one who has to make trouble.

KEVIN:
I'm the only one getting dumped on.

KATE:
You're the only one acting up. Now get upstairs!

KEVIN:
I am upstairs, dummy! (Kate opens the door to the third floor) The third floor?

KATE:
Go.

KEVIN:
It's scary up there.

KATE:
Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

KEVIN:
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him: he wets the bed. He'll pee all over me. I know it.

KATE:
Fine, we'll put him somewhere else.

KEVIN:
I'm sorry.

KATE:
It's too late. Get upstairs. (Kevin walks up stairs and stops)

KEVIN:
Everyone in this family hates me.

KATE:
Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.

KEVIN:
I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck!

KATE:
Just stay up there! I don't want to see you again for the rest of the night.

KEVIN:
I don't want to see you again for the rest of my whole life. And I don't want to see anybody else either.

KATE:
I hope you don't mean that. You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow morning and you didn't have a family.

KEVIN:
No, I wouldn't.

KATE:
Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.

KEVIN:
I hope I never see any of you jerks again. (Kevin walks upstairs, Kate closes the door)

(CUT TO THE THIRD FLOOR)
